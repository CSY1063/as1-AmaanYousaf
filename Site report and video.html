        <h3>Here is a bit more about me and this project!</h3>
        <p>I am currently a student at the University of Northampton England learning new skills and improving myself daily. I created this web site using HTML and CSS.
          I just love to create clean and minimal software its just a personal preference. For this project site, it took me a few days to get it done but I play on a few more features the most important one being the hamburger menu for mobile devices as its way more convenient and adds to the clean appeal.
          Some animations can also make this site a bit more lively and active. That is my next plan.
          I used fontawesome for adding the social media icons. Also initially the top navigation was hard to make responsive but I did take help from a few old blogs which made it so much better.
          I just think this website can make use of some good animations and better pictures just to fill it up just a little bit so it doesnt look empty.
